        The groundwork for today&apos;s solid base began in 1982. The Heart
        Foundation of Malaysia was established by a small group of dedicated and
        concerned lay people who were determined to make an impact on the
        control of heart and blood vessel disease.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the 1960&apos;s, deaths in Malaysia were due to communicable diseases
        such as tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid and cholera. Our health system
        was then developing and our health facilities were inadequate to meet
        the needs and demands of the population.
        <br />
        <br />
        With the improved standard of living and better understanding, now,
        there is a control of these diseases. However, more than 20 years later,
        heart disease death rates and stroke deaths have increased and has
        become the No. 1 killer. More people are being affected by heart and
        blood vessel diseases.
        <br />
        <br />
        We believe we can share in the effort to prevent and control the
        situation. Educating the public by bringing awareness has resulted in
        encouraging response from the society. Heart and blood vessel disease is
        our major killer, claiming almost twice as many lives as cancer and
        accounting for a high percentage of all certified deaths each year. In
        1995, 28.2 % of all medically reported deaths in Malaysia were
        attributed to CVD (cardiovascular diseases). By international standards,
        this figure does cause a concern for Malaysia.
        <br />

          The Heart Foundation of Malaysia is a non-profit and non-governmental
          organisation
        </b>{' '}
        dedicated to the education of the public on heart and circulatory
        diseases. We are funded almost entirely by public support from our
        well-meaning society. In addition, we receive some limited government
        co-operation for specific projects. The Foundation&apos;s heart-health
        message is direct and effective - enjoy healthy eating, exercise, be
        smoke-free and check your blood pressure regularly.
