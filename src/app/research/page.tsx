        We need a focus on research based and applicable to the Malaysian environment. 
        This is simply to encourage our own medical researchers to take advantage of 
        international medical advances and to incorporate them into situations applicable 
        to the Malaysian population.
        <br />
        <br />
        We recognize our responsibility to support Malaysian research into cardiovascular 
        diseases and the Foundation plans to grant more awards to local research whenever
        the need arises.
