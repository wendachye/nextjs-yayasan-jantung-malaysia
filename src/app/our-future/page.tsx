        While we have traveled a long way, there is a tough journey still ahead
        of us. The percentage of medically certified deaths attributed to
        cardiovascular diseases have exceeded that of even cancer and has become
        the No 1 killer disease in Malaysia.
        <br />
        <br />
        There still needs much to be done and we certainly ask for your support.
        For example, in the next 12 months we aim to extend training in Basic
        Life Support to all Malaysians.
        <br />
        <br />
        We aim to build an active publishing programme in order to provide
        resource material to schools, workplaces and the community and develop
        an active Resource Centre.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>We aim to:</b>
        <br />
        Work with health professionals to hold training seminars for personnel
        interested in working in areas such as cardiac rehabilitation, nutrition
        etc.

            Poor health behaviour often starts in childhood. The Heart
            Foundation of Malaysia hope to work towards promoting a healthy
            lifestyle programme in preschools and schools with the co-operation
            of the Ministries of Health and Education.
