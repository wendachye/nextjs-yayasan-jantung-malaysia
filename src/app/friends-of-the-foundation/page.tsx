        The Heart Foundation of Malaysia invites you to become a Friend of the
        Heart Foundation. Your support will ensure that we can continue working
        together to reduce the incidence of heart and blood vessel disease
        including stroke in our community and improve the quality of life.
        <br />
        <br />
        You may not wish to be part of the administrative structure of the
        Foundation or to attend annual meetings, but simply want to express your
        goodwill and encouragement in a practical way. You can do this by
        becoming one of our Friends through an annual donation.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a Friend of the Heart Foundation, you will receive regular mailouts
        of our newsletters which will keep you abreast of the Foundation's
        activities and other information which we hope will be of interest to
        you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Should you wish greater involvement, as a Friend of the Foundation you
        may wish to start Healthy Heart Clubs in your area to further promote
        awareness of the Foundation's aims, work and activities.
        <br />
