        partnership between YJM and NESTLÉ OMEGA PLUS, having collaborated to
        co-organise the walk for the past 13 years.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since 2001, participation has continued to grow from year to year. By
        utilising social media platforms such as Facebook for registration this
        year, Walk-A-Mile was able to double its number of participants from
        1,200 participants in 2013 to over 2,000 participants in 2014! More
        importantly, the participants comprise of Malaysians young and old from
        all walks of life, and sees a significant number of families
        participating together.
        <br />
        <br />
        The 2014 Walk-A-Mile is centred on the World Heart Day&apos;s theme of
        &apos;At the Heart of Health&apos;, with the aim of raising awareness
        amongst Malaysians to adopt heart healthy lifestyles and make more
        careful decisions about their diet towards lowering bad cholesterol
        levels as well as ensuring that people are able to make heart-healthy
        choices wherever they live, work and play.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pledging his support towards making heart-healthy choices, Yang Amat
        Berbahagia Tun Ahmad Sarji bin Abdul Hamid President, Yayasan Jantung
        Malaysia (YJM) officiated the event before proceeding to walk alongside
        the participants.
        <br />
        <br />
        “As heart diseases have continued to rise through the years, it has
        become more critical than ever to advocate heart healthy lifestyles not
        only for ourselves but also to our family and friends,” said Tun Ahmad
        Sarji. “I believe strongly in the values behind the World Heart Day
        Walk-A-Mile because possessing knowledge sometimes is not enough. We
        must take action and small steps in our diet and activities to ensure
        our hearts are healthy until we grow old.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Other notable guests who took part in the walk include Datuk Dr J.S.
        Sambhi, Chairman of YJM; Dato' Dr Rosli Mohd Ali, President, National
        Heart Association of Malaysia; and Mr. Alois Hofbauer, Region Head
        Nestlé Malaysia and Singapore.
        <br />
        <br />
        Datuk Dr J.S. Sambhi, Chairman of YJM, underlined the growing risk of
        cardiovascular disease amongst Malaysians. “According to the National
        Health and Morbidity Survey 2011, statistics, Coronary Heart Disease is
        the no.1 killer in Malaysia, accounting for 25.4% of the total mortality
        rate. Hence, YJM believes that there needs to be a great urgency to
        cultivate environments where Malaysians can make healthier choices to
        mitigate risks of cardiovascular diseases. We find it highly encouraging
        that more than 2,000 have turned up today and hope to grow this cause in
        years to come,” he said.
        <br />
        <br />
        This year&apos;s Walk-A-Mile event concept was redesigned to provide
        participants a fresh and educational experience, which included fun
        facts and heart health tips along the route. In addition to the walk, a
        new Family Fun Route was introduced, whereby there were numerous games
        stations which were not only educational, but was also fun and engaging
        for the entire family to learn more about caring for their hearts.
        <br />
        <br />
        Participants were also treated to free health screenings, live stage
        performances, lucky draws, and free samples of NESTLÉ OMEGA PLUS, which
        contains ACTICOL , plant sterols which is scientifically proven to lower
        blood cholesterol levels.

        RM30,000 to Datuk Dr J.S. Sambhi, Chairman of Yayasan Jantung Malaysia
        towards the continuous support on the efforts and dedication of YJM to
