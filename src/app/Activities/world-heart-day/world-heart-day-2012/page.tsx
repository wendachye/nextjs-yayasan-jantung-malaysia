        <b>Sunday, 30th September, 2012:</b> The participants of the World Heart
        Day celebrations at Taman Tasik Titiwangsa, Kuala Lumpur were greeted by
        a beautiful sunlit day.
        <br />
        <br />
        The focus of this year&apos;s celebrations was the Walk-A-Mile event
        which was officially launched by YABHG Tun Ahmad Sarji bin Abdul Hamid,
        President of The Heart Foundation of Malaysia. A total of around 1300
        people turned up at this year&apos;s event.
        <br />
        <br />
        All participants received heart-shaped balloons and free T-shirts
        emblazoned with logos of the World Heart Federation. After the Walk,
        they had the opportunity to attend the various other activities that
        were also held in conjunction with World Heart Day.
        <br />
        <br />
        These activities included poster exhibitions, health screening,
        nutritional talks and healthy breakfast meals from Nestle, quiz games,
        lucky draws, and also included demonstrations for gymnastics, jump-rope,
        aerobic dance, line dancing, and even traditional self-defence and
        martial arts.
