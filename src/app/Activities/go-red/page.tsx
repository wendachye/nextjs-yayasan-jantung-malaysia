        Each year over 8.6 million women globally die of heart disease and
        stroke.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is more than the total number of women who die from all cancers,
        tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria combined. And yet, most heart disease
        and stroke is preventable.
        <br />
        <br />
        Together with its members across the world, the World Heart Federation
        is running the Go Red for Women campaign to improve women's knowledge of
        heart disease and stroke so that they can take action and achieve
        longer, better heart-healthy lives.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Go Red for Women</b> is an international awareness campaign dedicated
        to the prevention, diagnosis and control of cardiovascular disease in
        Women.
