        There are many key factors you have to ensure you follow on a regular
        basis to lose weight.
        <br />
        <br />
        You have to follow a really good diet, get enough rest, and perform some
        type of weight training to increase your muscle so you also get
        stronger.
        <br />
        <br />
        But there is also one more thing you can do to speed up your fatloss,
        and that's..... <b>Doing Aerobic Exercise!!</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>AEROBIC EXERCISE!!</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Aerobic exercise is exercise such as running, cycling, swimming, etc.
        Weightlifting or weight training is considered to be an-aerobic
        exercise.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you're trying to lose weight, you should be doing aerobic exercise
        3-4 times per week for 30 minutes per session.
        <br />
        <br />
        The first thing you must do though, when starting to do aerobic exercise
        is to figure out your maximum heart rate. Here's how to do it:
        <br />
        <hr />
        The calculation for determining your maximum heart rate is 220 minus
        your age. So if you're 30 years old, the calculation is as follows:
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>220 - 30 = 190 maximum heart rate</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        As you get older, your maximum heart rate gets lower. Remember, this
        calculation is not set in stone. It is a rough average.
        <br />
        <hr />
        When I was 20, I got my heart rate up to 205-206 beats per minute while
        I was climbing a 15% hill for a kilometer on my racing bicycle. My
        maximum heart rate should have been 200, so you can see this calculation
        is just an estimate.
        <br />
        <br />
        So using the 30 year old in our example who's maximum heart rate is 190
        beats per minute, we need to make sure that person is doing aerobic
        exercise at 65-70% of his maximum for best results. We calculate this as
        follows:
        <br />
        <br />
        190 x 0.65 = 123.5 beats per minute at 65%
        <br />
        So after an initial warm-up of 5 minutes on the stationary bike (or
        other exercise you choose), make sure your heart rate is above 123.5
        beats per minute for the other 20 minutes, before you warm down.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can check your heart rate by a couple of methods.You place your
        index finger while you're doing your aerobics on the artery on your
        neck. While you do this, count the beats over a 15 second span (look at
        you watch).
        <br />
        <br />
        Multiply the number of beats over 15 seconds by 4 to get a beat per
        minute figure.
        <br />
        <br />
        Using our example again, we check our pulse and notice 30 beats over 15
        seconds. We multiply this by 4 and we arrive at 120 beats per minute. We
        see that this is lower than 123.5 beats so we start pedaling a little
        bit faster and check the heart rate again in a few minutes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pretty soon, you'll figure out how fast and hard you have to pedal to
        stay between 65-70% of your maximum.
        <br />
        <br />
        Warm up for 5 minutes, stay in you 65-70% target zone for 20 minutes,
        then cool down for the last 5 minutes and you're done.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, I would suggest you perform the aerobic exercise first thing in the
        morning as soon as you get up before you eat.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your body has been fasting while you sleep and it may have been 8-12
        hours since you last ate. This is the best time to do aerobic exercise,
        because you will burn more fat and get better results.
        <br />
        <br />
        But, if you can't do the aerobic exercise at night, no problem. The main
        thing and most important thing is THAT YOU DO IT. Even if it's late at
        night.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you get down to the body fat level you want, cut that back to 2-3
        times per week 20-30 minutes each, mainly for cardiovascular exercise
        for your heart, not so much for the calorie burning benefits.
        <br />
        <br />
        Good luck with all you fatloss & fitness goals.!
