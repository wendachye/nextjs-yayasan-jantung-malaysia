      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What are arrhythmias</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Normal cardiac rhythm result from electrical impulses that start in the
        sinoatrial (SA or sinus) node. They spread in a timely way through the
        atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node. From there wach impulse travels
        over the many speacialized fibers of the His-Purkinje system,
        distributing the electrical "ignition signal" to the ventricular muscle
        cells.
        <br />
        <br />
        The transmission of impulses is delayed a fraction within the AV node.
        This allows time for the atrial contraction that helps fill the
        ventricles with blood.
        <br />
        <br />
        The term arrhythmia refers to any change from this normal sequence of
        beginning and conducting impulses. Some arryhthmias are so brief (for
        example, a temporary pause or premature beat) that the overall heart
        rate isn&apos;t greatly afeccted. However, if arrhythmias last some
        time, they may cause the heart rate to be too slow or too fast.
        <br />
        <br />
        It&apos;s worth knowing that the average Australian male eats 26g of
        fibre per day and the average Australian female eats 20g per day. So we
        are not far off. We just need a little more fibre each day.
        <br />
        <br />
        The term bradycardia is used to decribe a rate of less than 60 beats per
        minute. Tachycardia usually refers to a heart rate or more than 100
        beats per minute.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>How does arrhythmias occur?</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Cells in the heart&apos;s conduction system, from the sinus node down to
        the outer branches of the His-Purkinje system, can fire automatically
        and begin electrical activity. Normally, the sinus node contains the
        heart&apos;s most rapidly firing cells. (This allows that area to be a
        natural pacemaker.) Subsidiary pacemaker elsewhere in the heart provide
        a " back-up" rhythm when the sinus node doesn&apos;t work properly or
        when the transmission of impulses is blocked somewhere in the conduction
        system.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under certain conditions the automatic firing rate of secondary
        pacemaker tissue may become too fast. It such an abnormal "focus" fires
        faster than the sinus node, it may take over control of the heart rhythm
        and produce tachycardia.
        <br />
        <br />
        Arrythmias also may develop because of abnormalities in how impulses are
        conducted. Delays in the spreading of impulses can occur anywhere in the
        conduction system. When the transmission of impulses is intermittently
        or completely blocked ( heart block), bradycardia may result. In such
        cases, subsidiary pacemaker cells (located beyond the conduction block)
        may maintain cardiac rhythm.
        <br />
        <br />
        In another type of abnormal conduction, impulses get caught in a
        merry-go-round like sequence. This process, called reentry is a common
        cause of tachycardias. Regardless of what cause them, tachycardias may
        be subclasssified according to where they arise. Thus, ventricular
        tachycardias originate in the heart&apos;s lower chambers.
        Supraventricular tachycardias arise higher in the heart, either in the
        upper chambers (atria) or the middle region (AV node or the very
        beginning portion of the His-Purkinje system).
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What are the symptoms arrhythmias ?</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Arrhythmias can produce a broad range of symptoms, from barely
        perceptible to cardiovascular collapse and death. When they&apos;re very
        brief, arrhythmias are most likely to be almost without symptoms. For
        example, a single premature beat may be perceived as a "palpitation" or
        "skipped beat". Premature beats that are frequent or occur in rapid
        succession during a nonsustained or sustained tachycardia may cause a
        greater awareness of heart palpitations or a fluttering sensation in the
        chest or neck.
        <br />
        <br />
        When arrhythmias last long enough to affect how well the heart works,
        more serious symptoms may develop. At slower rates, the heart may not be
        able to pump enough blood to the body. This can cause fatique,
        lightheaded-ness, loss of consciousness or even death. Death occurs if
        the heart rate is zero or slow that the heart and brain stop working.

        the heart rate is zero or slow that the heart and brain stop working.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tachycardias can reduce the heart&apos;s ability to pump by interfering
        with the ventricular chambers&apos; ability to properly fill with blood.
        They do this by reducing the time for such filing or by interfering with
        the booster effect normally provided by timely contraction of the atria
        (or both).
        <br />
        <br />
        Loss of this atrial "kick" during tachycardia may be caused by a change
        from the usual sequence of atrial and ventricular activity. It also can
        be caused by rapid chaotic electrical activity in the upper chambers
        (for example, atrial fibrillation). The reduced pumping efficiency that
        can develop during tachycardia may be worse by underlying heart muscle
        abnormalities or atherosclerotic blocks in the coronary arteries.
        It&apos;s not surprising, then, that tachycardias can produce shortness
        of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.
        <br />
        <br />
        When the heart&apos;ss ability to work is greatly reduced for a
        prolonged time, cardiac arrest and death are likely. This may result
        from ventricular fibrillation (an extremely rapid, chaotic rhythm during
        which the heart quivers). If the heart can continue to pump normally,
        though, some ventricular tachycardia (even those that last for minutes
        or hours) may be well tolerated without a loss of consciousness or
        cardiac arrest. Tachycardia may be nonsustained (lasting only seconds)
        or sustained (lasting for minutes or hours ).
        <br />
        <br />
        Tachycardias sometimes can cause serious injury to other organ systems.
        For example, the brain, kidneys, lung or liver may be damaged during
        prolonged cardiac arrest. Also, blood clots can form in the upper heart
        chambers as a result of atrial fibrillation. They may break free and
        cause a stroke or damage other organs.

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Who is prone to arrhythmias ? </h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Although there&apos;s great variation in the their severity, arrhythmias
        occur through the population. On an everyday level, the heart rate
        speeds up (sinus tachycardia ) during physical activity, stress or
        excitement, and slows down (sinus bradycardia) during sleep. Even beyond
        these daily changes, probably everyone at one time or another develops
        premature atrial or ventricular beats. In fact, during a 24 hour period
        about one&apos; fifth of health adults are likely to have frequent or
        multiple types of ventricular premature beats. (This even includes short
        episodes of ventricular tachycardia in a small percentage of monitored
        people).
        <br />
        <br />
        The prevalence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias tends to increase
        with age, even when there&apos;s no overt sign of heart disease. Certain
        congenital conditions may make a person prone to arrhythmias. For
        example, an incompletely developed conduction system can cause chronic
        heart block and braddycardia. On the other hand, people born with extra
        conduction pathways, either near the AV node or bridging the atria and
        ventricles, are prone to reentrant supraventricular tachycardias.
        <br />
        <br />
        Still, acquired heart disease is the most important factor predisposing
        a person to arrhythmias. The main causes are atherosclerosis,
        hypertension and inflammatory or degenerative conditions. The scarring
        or abnormal tissue deposits found with these disease can cause
        bradycardias : they do this by interfering with the work of the sinus
        node or overall AV conduction. Likewise, they can cause tachycardias
        (originating in either the atria or ventricles ) by causing cells to
        fire abnormally or by creating islands of electrically inert tissue.
        (Impulses circulate in a reentrant fashion around these areas).
        <br />
        <br />
        A variety of other factors may predispose a person to develop
        arrhythmias. Prominent among them is the part of the autonomic nervous
        system that&apos;s involved in cardiovascular regulation. One element of
        this control system slows the sinus rate and depresses AV nodal
        conduction. (These effects may prevail during sleep or in athletically
        well trained people )The opposing element of the autonomic nervous
        system tends to speed up the firing rate of the sinus node and other
        pacemaker tissue in the heart. Further it may also make it easier for
        reentrant tachycardias to occur. (or both).
        <br />
        <br />
        Many chemical agents may provoke arrhythmias, sometimes with serious
        consequences. Known factors include high or low blood and tissue
        concentrations of a variety of minerals, such as potassium, magnesium
        and calcium. These play a vital role in starting and conducting normal
        impulses in the heart. Addictive substances especially alcohol,
        cigarettes and recreational drugs can provoke arrhythmias as can various
        cardiac medications. Even drugs used to treat an arrhythmia may provoke
        another arrhythmia.
