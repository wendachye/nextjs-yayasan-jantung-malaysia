        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>START NOW!</b>
            <ul>
              <li>For about a week, record everything you eat, how much, when and where, what you were doing when you ate, whom you were with and your mood. Then analyze your record. If you seen any bad habits, start changing them.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>GET MOVING</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Make time to exercise for at least 3 times a week for a minimum of 15-30 minutes each time.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>LOSE WISELY</b>
            <ul>
              <li>A weight loss of ½ to 1 kg a week is safe. Anything more is not advisable. To lose about ½ kg a week, eat 250 calories less per day and burn off 250 calories of more in exercises.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>PARTICIPATE</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Join after-work exercise class or school sports. It's more fun to exercise with family or friends.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>EXERCISE REGULARLY</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Make it a part of your daily routine! Take the stairs instead of the lift whenever you can.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>WEIGH YOURSELF MONTHLY</b>
            <ul>
              <li>You weight changes daily so weigh yourself only once a month and at the same time of the day.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>BE ACTIVE</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Don't just sit around! Take a walk, jog, swim, or cycle. For a change try dancing or doing Calisthenics in time to music.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>EAT RIGHT!</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Cut down sweets, facts, and salt. Eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>AVOID CRASH DIET!</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Fat diets and diet pills are not recommended for weight loss. In fact quick weight loss is due to loss of water and muscle, not fat.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>MINIMISE THE MUNCHIES</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Watch out for those bags of ships. You could devour these a whole bag in front of the TV or whilst reading without knowing.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>REMOVE TEMPTATION
            </b>
            <ul>
              <li>Get rid of food from your office and bedroom. Store everything you eat in the kitchen only.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>EAT, DRINK, AND BE HEALTHY</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Water is an essential liquid. You need about 8 glasses daily. Drinking a glass before you eat will help make you feel fuller and you may eat less.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>ENTERTAIN BUT DON'T BE PLAIN</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Prepare tasty, nutritious and low calorie snacks in place of salty, greasy, and sweet ones. Serve pure fruit juices or soda water.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>EAT LESS, EXERCISE MORE</b>
            <ul>
              <li>No single food is fattening but too much of anything can be. Burn off extra calories by exercising. Myth: Exercise won't increase your appetite.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>DIETER'S DELIGHT</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Don't give up all your favourite foods. Simply eat less than you usually do. Have two slices of kuih lapis instead of three and cut your cake into eight slices instead of six.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>SKIM THE FAT FROM YOUR FOOD</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Choose foods that have been broiled, baked or steamed instead of fried. A baked potato has 80 calories while a packet of French fries has over 200. Replace full cream milk with low fat milk as a drink or a creamer for your favourite beverages.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>TASTE AND ENJOY FOOD!</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Chew your food slowly and enjoy every bite. Take smaller servings.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>PICK THE WINNING COMBINATION</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Choose a variety of wholesome foods and keep active.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
