        What is Familial Hypercholesterolemia (Inherited Cholesterol Disorder)?
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Familiar Hypercholesterolemia or FH in short is a genetic disorder that
        is passed from one generation to another. It is a condition where the
        boy is unable to remove the bad cholesterol (low density lipoprotein or
        LDL) from the blood.
        <br />
        <br />
        The problem stems from an abnormal gene that maybe present in one or
        both parents. When a child inherits an abnormal gene from one parent the
        condition is called Heterozygous FH. It usually affects 1 in 400 people
        and if left untreated, can cause coronary artery disease at the age of
        40 to 45.
        <br />
        <br />
        When 2 heterozygotes marry and when one of their children inherit the FH
        gene from each of them, the child will then have an extreme form of the
        disorder, known as homozygous FH. This is an extremely rare case and
        occurs in about 1 in 1 million people. In such cases cholesterol levels
        maybe as much as 4 times their normal value and if left untreated people
        with this condition often develop atherosclerosis by their early teens
        and die from heart attack or sudden death before the age of 20.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>How can FH be Detected?</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Detecting FH in its early stages is extremely beneficial as it can
        prevent the atherosclerotic process, which begins in childhood.
        <br />
        <br />
        In children, FH can be detected while the children is still in the
        mother's womb by testing the child's blood from umbilical cord. The
        other option is to test a child's cholesterol level by the age of 2
        especially in families with a history of high cholesterol and heart
        attacks.
        <br />
        <br />
        In adults, clues to the presence of FH include white rings around the
        iris, lumps in the tendon on the backs of the hands and ancles and also
        lump on the knees.
        <br />
        <br />
        Screening of first-degree relatives (brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts
        and cousins) of FH patients is an extremely effective method in
        identifying FH at an early stage. When one FH patient is identified many
        other silence FH sufferers can be detected and this will help diffuse
        the silently ticking time bombs in families where premature heart
        attacts are the norm.
        <br />
        <br />
        DNA testing is the latest diagnostic test that is said to be the most
        sensitive in identifying FH patients. It can help increase the
        identification of FH sufferers by another 16.6%.
        <br />
        <br />
        What are the Risks Associated with FH?
        <br />
        <br />
        The main risk is death or disability from atherosclerosis, especially of
        the coronary arteries. This risk is greater than for other types of
        hyperlipidemia because hypercholesterolemia is more severe and is
        present throughout life. Apart from this increased risk of coronary
        disease, individuals with FH are normally in all other aspects.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>How is FH Treated? </h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        <ol>
          <li>In Children</li>
          Statins are usually the preferred drugs as they have been very
          extensively studied and have been proven to be very safe for children
          according to studies conducted in Belgium. Statins are not only
          effective in reducing cholesterol levels but are also found to be very
          safe in children as young as 6 years old.
          <br />
          Drug treatment has to go hand-in-hand with lifestyle modifications
          like diet and ecercise. It is not possible to be too strict with a
          child's diet, as they need a wide variety of nutrients. A healthy
          combination of foods from the various food groups is important to them
          for their continued growth and development. It is important to avoid
          fast foods, snacks like chips and chocolate bars and to avoid soft
          drinks with lots of sugar. Consult a dietician for advice on healthy
          food choices for your child.
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>In Adult</li>
          Drug therapy is always prescribed for FH patients, as the blood
          cholesterol values in these patients are very high. Again statins are
          the drugs of choice in the treatment of FH as they are highly
          effective and well tolerated with minimal side effects. Usually a
          combination of statin-resin drug therapy is used to treat FH patients
          in order to reach target blood cholesterol values. Sometimes nicotinic
          acid and fibrates are also prescribed as an addition in resistant
          cases.
          <br />
          <br />
          In homozygotes, additional measures maybe required like
          Plasmapheresis. This consists of removing the blood and returning it
          after LDL is filtered out. This will help lower the blood cholesterol
          level. The only drawback to this method of therapy is that it is
          rather expensive and time cosuming.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ileal bypass is a surgical intervention that lowers blood cholesterol
          and bile acid uptake from the gut. Although the effectiveness of this
          procedure in lowering the risk of heart attacks is well proven,
          complications of this procedure such as diarrhea are difficult to live
          with.
          <br />
          <br />
          Liver transplant is another option.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is absolutely essential that diet modification and exercise to
          reduce weight go hand-in-hand with drug treatement. Cut down on animal
          foods and fatty or oily foods. Eat more wholegrain foods, cereals,
          legumes, fruits and vegetables. And exercise at least 3 to 4 times a
          week for a minimum of 30 minutes.
        </ol>
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Drug Therapy</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        There are 4 types of drugs used to treat high cholesterol. They include:
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors)</li>
          Statins work quickly by lowering cholesterol within one to two weeks.
          Cholesterol levels keep dropping until about four to six weeks of
          treatment. After this point, the levels usually hold steady as long as
          you stay on the medication. You may need to take statins for a long
          time to keep your cholesterol levels in check.
          <br />
          Statins work by interfering directly with the manufacture of
          cholesterol in the body, specifically by blocking an enzyme called
          HMG-CoA reductase, which the body needs to make cholesterol. With less
          cholesterol in the body the liver is encouraged to remove more LDL
          from the bloodstream. As cholesterol in the bloodstream goes down, so
          too does the risk of clogged blood vessels and heart disease.
          <li>Bile acid sequestrants (bile acid resins)</li>
          Your liver secretes bile acids, which aid digestion by breaking down
          dietary fats in the intestines. These drugs binds to the bile acids,
          causing them to be passed with the stool. With fewer bile acids in
          circulation, the liver is prompted to convert more cholesterol into
          bile acids(80% of the cholesterol made by the liver is used to make
          bile) encouraging the removal of LDL from the blood.
          <li>Niacin (nicotinic acid)</li>
          Niacin can lower LDL levels in as little as five to seven days. How
          much cholesterol is reduced depends on the dosage. When combined with
          bile acid sequestrants, the result can be even lower LDL levels - a
          reduction of as much as 40% to 60%.
          <li>Fibric acid derivates</li>
          Lowering triglycerides fats and may also help in raising HDL levels.
        </ol>
        <br />
        Among them statins are the most commonly prescribed drugs for lowering
        cholesterol. This is because they have been very extensively studied and
        have been proven to be very effective in patients with minimal side
        effects.
        <br />

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is Cholesterol?</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Cholesterol is a soft waxy substance found in all your body's cell.
        Despite all the nasty things that you've heard about cholesterol, you
        need a certain amount of it to live:- Cholesterol is essential to your
        body's cell membranes, to the insulation of your nerves, and for the
        production of certain hormones. It is also used by your liver to make
        bile acids, which helps in the digestion of food.
        <br />
        <br />
        Interestingly, the majority of cholesterol in your blood is manufactured
        by your own body - mainly by your liver - and only 20% comes from the
        food you consume, especially animal based foods like milk products and
        meat as well as some cooking oil.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Good and Bad Cholesterol</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        As cholesterol can't be transported in blood special carries called
        lipoproteins transport it to and from cells. There are 2 kinds of
        lipoproteins that you need to be concern about.
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>LDL(Low-Density Lipoprotein)</li>
          <ul>
            When too much LDL circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in
            the walls of the arteries and can form plaque (thick hard deposits)
            that can clog up arteries. If a clot forms where the plaque is,
            oxygen-rich blood flow can be blocked to the heart muscles leading
            to a heart attack. If the clot blocks the blood flow to part of the
            brain a strok can manifest. This is why a high level of LDL is
            reffered to as the bad cholesterol. Lowering LDL levels will help
            reduce the plaque buildup in your arteries leading to healthier
            arteries. HDL (high-density lipoprotein)
          </ul>
          <li>LDL(Low-Density Lipoprotein)</li>
          <ul>
            HDL cholesterol is called the good cholesterol because it contains a
            relatively small amount of cholesterol itself and carries away
            harmful fatty deposits from cells and tissues to the liver for
            excretion from the body. This helps prevent the buildup of
            cholesterol in the walls of your arteries.
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Your Cholesterol Reading</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
      Cholesterol readings generally include total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is important to take note of all 3 readings and not just total cholesterol.
