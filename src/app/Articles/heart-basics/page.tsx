      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is heart attack?</h2>
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Heart attacks result from blood vessel disease in the heart. Coronary
        heart disease (CHD), sometimes referred to as coronary artery disease
        (CAD), are general names for heart attack (and angina).
        <br />
        <br />
        A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when the blood supply
        to part of the heart muscle itself (the myocardium) is severely reduced
        or stopped. This occurs when one of the coronary arteries (the arteries
        that supply blood to the heart muscle) is blocked by an obstruction,
        such as a blood clot that has formed on plaque due to atherosclerosis.
        Such an event is sometimes called a coronary thrombosis or coronary
        occlusion.
        <br />
        <br />

        <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is angina?</h2>
        Chest pain called angina pectoris is another result of coronary artery
        disease. Angina is a symptom of a condition called myocardial schema,
        which occurs when the heart muscle (myocardium) doesn't get as much
        blood (hence as much oxygen) as it needs for a given level of work. Lack
        of blood supply is called ischemia.
        <br />
        <br />
        <hr />
        <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is silent ischemia?</h2>
        Some people have ischemia, which means not enough blood flows to a part
        of the body's tissue. This occurs when spasm or disease narrows the
        arteries bringing blood to the heart. As many as three to four million
        Americans may have ischemia episodes without knowing it. These people
        have silent ischemia. They may have a heart attack with no prior
        warning.

        <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>
          What is the heart's collateral circulation?
        </h2>
        Collateral circulation involves small arteries that connect two larger
        coronary arteries of different segments of the same artery. They provide
        an alternate route for blood flow to the heart muscle. Everyone has
        collateral vessels, at least in microscopic form. These vessels aren't
        open under normal conditions but grow and enlarge in some people with
        coronary heart disease. When a collateral vessel enlarges, it lets blood
        flow from an open artery to either adjacent artery or further downstream
        on the same artery. Myocardial ischemia stimulates the growth of
        collateral vessels, so they can form a kind of "detour"around a blockage
        and provide alternate routes of blood flow.
        <br />
        <br />
        Research has shown that while everyone has collateral vessels, they
        don't open and become available in all people. People who have open
        collateral vessels can benefit, because collateral vessels help protect
        heart muscle from tissue death if the normal blood supply is cut off.
        <br />
        <br />
        <hr />
        <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is arrhythmias?</h2>
        Normal cardiac rhythm results from electrical impulses that start in the
        sinoatrial (SA or sinus) node. They spread in a timely way through the
        atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node. From there each impulse travels
        over the many specialized fibers of the His-Purkinje system,
        distributing the electrical "ignition signal" to the ventricular muscle
        cells.
        <br />
        <br />
        The transmission of impulses is delayed a fraction within the AV node.
        This allows time for the atrial contraction that helps fill the
        ventricles with blood.
        <br />
        <br />
        The term arrhythmias refers to any change from this normal sequence of
        beginning and conducting impulses. Some arrhythmias are so brief (for
        example, a temporary pause or premature beat) that the overall heart
        rate isn't greatly affected. However, if arrhythmias last for some time,
        they may cause the heart rate to be too slow or too fast.
        <br />
        <br />
        The term bradycardia is used to describe a rate of less than 60 beats
        per minute. Tachycardia usually refers to a heart rate of more than 100
        beats per minute.
        <br />

        <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is sudden cardiac death (SCD)?</h2>
        It's the sudden, abrupt loss of heart function (i.e. cardiac arrest) in
        a person who may or may not have diagnosed heart disease, but in whom
        the time and mode of death occur unexpectedly. The unexpected nature of
        the event is the key point in the definition.
        <br />
        <br />

        <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is a stroke?</h2>
        Stroke is a form of cardiovascular disease that affects the arteries of
        the central nervous system. A stroke (or "brain attack") occurs when a
        blood vessel bringing oxygen and nutrients to the brain bursts or is
        clogged by a blood clot or some other particle. Because of this rupture
        or blockage, part of the brain doesn't get the flow of blood it needs.
        Deprived of oxygen, nerve cells in the affected area of the brain can't
        function and die within minutes. And when nerve cells can't function,
        the part of the body controlled by these cells can't function either.
        The devastating effects of stroke are often permanent because dead brain
        cells aren't replaced.

        <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is rheumatic heart disease?</h2>
        Rheumatic heart disease is a condition in which the heart valves are
        damaged by a disease process that begins with a strep throat
        (streptococcal infection). If it's not treated, the streptoccocal
        infection can develop into acute rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is an
        inflammatory disease that can affect many connective tissues of the
        body, especially those of the heart, the joints, the brain or the skin.
        When rheumatic fever permanently damages the heart, the damage is called
        rheumatic heart disease.
        <br />
        <br />
        People of all ages can develop acute rheumatic fever, but it usually
        occurs in children 5 years to 15 years old. The resulting rheumatic
        heart disease can last for life.
        <br />
        <br />
        <hr />
        <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is congestive heart failure?</h2>
        Congestive heart failure is a condition that occurs because the heart
        muscle is damaged or overworked. This damage can result from high blood
        pressure, a heart attack, atherosclerosis, a congenital heart defect,
        heart muscle disease (called cardiomyopathy), rheumatic fever or high
        blood pressure in the lungs resulting from lung disease. Because it's
        damaged, the heart lacks the strength to keep blood circulating normally
        throughout the body. The "failing" heart keeps working but doesn't work
        as efficiently as it should.

        <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is Kawasaki Disease?</h2>
        Kawasaki disease (also known as Kawasaki syndrome or mucocutaneous lymph
        node syndrome) is a children's illness. It tends to strike most often
        under the age of 8. Boys are almost twice as likely to get it as girls;
        the disease also tends to appear more often among those of Asian
        ancestry.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fever, rash, swollen hands and feet, redness of the whites of the eyes,
        swollen lymph glands in the neck, and irritation and inflammation of the
        mouth, lips and throat all characterize Kawasaki disease.

        <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is bacterial endocarditis?</h2>
        Bacterial endocarditis is a serious infection of the heart valves or the
        tissues lining the heart. It rarely occurs but is a real threat to
        people with structural abnormalities of heart, artificial (prosthetic)
        heart valves or people with rheumatic or other acquired heart valve
        dysfunction. Also, people who've previously had bacterial endocarditis
        are at risk for getting it again, even when they don't have heart
        disease.
