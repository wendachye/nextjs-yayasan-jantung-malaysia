        Risks for heart & blood vessel disease
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Around 60% of all men and about 45% of all women are overweight or
        obese. According to the Heart Foundation 1/3 to 1/2 of Australians
        between 20 and 69 years have higher than recommended blood cholesterol
        levels. And it is shown in the number of early deaths. In 1996 just over
        10,000 people under the age of 70 died of heart and blood vessel
        disease.
        <br />
        <br />
        A key to a healthy heart and circulation is a balanced eating plan and
        lifestyle. If you have a balanced eating plan it can help you control
        three of the modifiable risk factors for heart and blood vessel disease,
        blood cholesterol levels, obesity and blood pressure. Physical activity
        and not smoking are also very important to help reduce your risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        A balanced eating plan is one high in carbohydrate from grains, fruits
        and vegetables and low in saturated fat. Variety and fiber rich foods
        are also important. The Heart Foundation recommends all adults need to
        eat 30 grams of fibre each day. In its booklet "Healthy Eating for the
        Heart" the Foundation says when decreasing saturated fat intake you
        should look to replace saturated fat with carbohydrates and fibre rich
        foods: whole grain breakfast cereals, oats, porridge, whole grain bread,
        wholemeal pasta, brown rice, barley, fruits and vegetables as well as
        legurnes like kidney, beans, baked beans and lentils.
        <br />
        <br />
        It&apos;s worth knowing that the average Australian male eats 26g of
        fibre per day and the average Australian female eats 20g per day. So we
        are not far off. We just need a little more fibre each day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Why? Couple of pieces of research. In 1996 the Journal of the American
        Medical Association published a study from Harvard School of Public
        Health which has examined more than 40,000 male health professional over
        a period of six years. They found that men who ate plenty of fibre had
        almost half as many heart attacks as men who ate little fibre. The study
        concluded that "fibre ... is an important dietary component for the
        prevention of coronary heart disease."
        <br />
        <br />

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>
        Fibre is an important dietary component
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Most foods in fibre contain both soluble and insoluble fibre, which
        provide different benefits. Soluble fibre is proven component in helping
        to lower blood cholesterol. Sources of soluble fibre include grains like
        oats and barley, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Only last year, the
        Journal of Nutrition published an analysis of the 12 most important
        studies on psyllium (a grain high in soluble fibre). The article
        concluded that people with blood cholesterol problems who ate a
        psyllium, rich cereal meal each day managed to lower their levels of
        blood cholesterol by 5% and their levels of LDL (the bad cholesterol) by
        9%. Lowering blood cholesterol is vital to our nation. According to the
        Heart Foundation, 20% of people aged 20 &ndash; 24 have blood
        cholesterol levels above the recommended maximum of 5.5 mmol/l. This
        portion rises as we age to 30% in people aged 25 &ndash; 29 to more than
        60% of us aged over 60.
        <br />
        <br />
        All these heart health benefits are also helped along by the traditional
        fibre that we used to call roughage. Insoluble fibre is found in grains
        like wheat bran, fruits and vegetable like corn. These foods tend to be
        more filling, delaying hunger and displacing fat from the diet. With
        obesity playing a major role in heart and blood vessel disease eating
        foods rich in insoluble fibre is an easy step to help you stay in shape
        not to mention better regularity.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Why eat more fibre?</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Eating more fibre rich foods each day will help us all manage our
        weight, reduce or maintain our blood cholesterol levels and, as the
        research shows, reduce our risk of heart and blood vessel disease. But
        remember regular physical activity and not smoking are important to help
        reduce your risk as well.
