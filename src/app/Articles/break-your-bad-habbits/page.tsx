        BREAK YOUR BAD HABITS AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF YOUR HEART!
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Giving up a few bad habits can help you live longer with less risk of
        heart disease and stroke. World Heart Federation cardiologist, Professor
        Antonio Bayés de Luna, recommends these antidotes to the most common
        risks.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>
          Eating foods are is high in saturated fats and cholesterol and
          consuming alcohol regularly{' '}
        </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you eat fried foods and red meat regularly, then you're in trouble.
        Foods that are high in saturated fats and cholesterol raise the level of
        cholesterol in your blood, increasing your risk of heart disease and
        stroke.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>The antidote:</b> Reduce your total fat consumption, especially
        saturated fats by choosing foods that are less than 5g fat/100g of
        product and by avoiding foods that are high in cholesterol (e.g.
        shrimps, liver and eggs). Also reduce your salt consumption, eat five
        portions of fruit and vegetables every day and increase your consumption
        of fish.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Smoking</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        You smoke light cigarettes (low-tar) because you're convinced that they
        are less dangerous than normal cigarettes or you don't smoke but you are
        regularly in a smoke filled environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>The antidote:</b> If you're a smoker, the first thing you have to do
        is decide whether you really want to quit. Choose your quit date and
        write it down. Set up your support systems by arranging to quit with a
        friend and distract yourself by changing your routine. Get rid of all
        cigarettes, clear out the car, hide all ashtrays and lighters. Smoking
        is not a habit, it is an addiction to nicotine. Treatments from your
        doctor or pharmacist can help you to stop smoking.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Lack of exercise</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Lack of physical activity, and therefore a sedentary lifestyle is
        clearly shown to be a risk factor for heart disease and type II
        diabetes.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>The antidote:</b> The heart is a muscle just like any other in our
        body. Make physical activity a part of your life. Ideally this should
        include 30 minutes of walking, cycling, gardening, dancing or even
        housework each day. And if you're fit, you can exercise for longer and
        with less effort than a person who is not in good condition.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Stress and sleep disorders</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        We all experience different degrees of stress in our daily life. But
        when you feel totally stressed at work or at home and can't fall asleep
        at night, week after week, it is believed that this may be a factor that
        puts you at greater risk of a heart attack.
        <br />
        <br />
        Stress-induced hormones put an additional load on your heart and sleep
        disorders have negative effects on long-term health and can lead to high
        blood pressure, coronary heart disease and stroke. In many cases, sleep
        disorders result from stress.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>The antidote:</b> While learning to meditate can be difficult
        initially, here's the incentive- 20 minutes of deep meditation can be
        equal to three hours' sleep. If you can't meditate, then simply relax
        and breathe! Exercise is also a great tension reliever.
        <br />
        <hr />
        World Heart Federation President, Professor Mario Maranhão concludes:
        "Remember that heart disease is not inevitable, it is largely
        preventable. Preventive measures are, for the most part straightforward
        and will reduce the incidence of death and disability due to heart
        disease. We want people around the globe to hear that message on World
        Heart Day, on 30th September 2001 and take action."
