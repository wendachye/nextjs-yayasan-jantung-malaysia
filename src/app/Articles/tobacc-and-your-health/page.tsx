      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>What is Heart Attack?</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Heart attack results from blood vessel disease in the heart. Coronary
        heart disease (CHD), sometimes referred to as coronary after disease
        (CAD), are general names for heart attack (and angina).
        <br />
        <br />
        A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when the blood supply
        to part of the heart muscle itself (the myocardium) is severely reduced
        or stopped. This occurs when one of the coronary arteries (the arteries
        that supply blood to the heart muscle) is blocked by an obstruction,
        such as a blood clot that has formed on plaque due to atherosclerosis.
        Such an event is sometimes called a coronary thrombosis or coronary
        occlusion.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the blood supply is cut off drastically or for a long time, muscle
        cells suffer irreversible injury and die. Disability or death can
        result, depending on how much heart muscle is damaged. Sometimes a
        coronary artery temporarily contracts or goes into spasm. When this
        happens the artery narrows and blood flow to part of the heart muscle
        decreases or even stops. What causes a spasm is unclear, but it can
        occur in normal blood vessels as well as vessels partially blocked by
        atheroscleorosis. If a spasm is severe, a heart attach may result.

        What are the Symptoms of a Heart Attack?
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Sometimes the first indications of a heart attack come as warning
        signals. The actual diagnosis of a heart attack must be made by a
        physician who has studied the results of several tests. Besides
        reviewing a patient's complete medical history and giving a physical
        examination, a doctor will use an electrocardiogram (ECG) to discover
        any abnormalities caused by damage to the heart. Sometimes a blood test
        is used to detect abnormal levels of certain enzymes in the bloodstream.
        <br />

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>How is a Heart Attack Treated?</h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        When a heart attack occurs, it's critical to recognize the signals and
        respond immediately. Delaying may increase the damage to the heart and
        reduce the chance of survival. Anyone experiencing the warning signals
        of a heart attack should be taken immediately to the nearest hospital
        with 24-hour emergency cardiac care. People who become unconscious
        before reaching the emergency room may receive emergency cardiopulmonary
        resuscitation (CPR).
        <br />
        <br />
        Most communities have an emergency cardiac care system that can quickly
        respond. This prompt care for heart attack victims dramatically reduces
        damage to the heart. In fact, 80 percent of heart attack survivors can
        return to work within three months. Prompt care for heart attack victims
        isn't the only reason so many people recover so quickly, but it's an
        important one.
        <br />
        <br />
        The importance of time cannot be overemphasized. When a coronary artery
        gets blocked, the heart muscle doesn't die instantaneously - damage
        increases the longer an artery remains blocked. If a victim gets to an
        emergency room fast enough a form of reperfusion therapy (called
        thrombolysis) sometimes can be performed. It involves injecting
        injecting a thrombolytic (clot-dissolving) agent, such as streptokinase,
        urokinase or TPA (tissue plasminogen activator), to dissolve a clot in a
        coronary artery and restore some blood flow. There drugs must be used
        within a few (usually 1 -3) hours of a heart attack for best effect. The
        sooner a drug is used, the more effective it's likely to be.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the weeks following a heart attack, either PTCA (balloon angioplasty)
        or coronary artery bypass surgery may be performed to improve the blood
        supply to the heart muscle. Once part of the heart muscle dies, its
        function can't be restored. Function may be restored to areas with
        decreased blood flow, however.

        Is There Any Way to Reduce the Chance of a Heart Attack?
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Many scientific studies show that certain characteristics increase the
        risk of coronary heart disease. The four major modifiable risk factors
        are cigarette / tobacco smoke, high blood cholesterol, high blood
        pressure and physical inactivity. Other contributing risk factors are
        diabetes mellitus and obesity.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Heart Foundation strongly urges people to control their modifiable
        risk factors. Also, people with angina should take episodes of chest
        pain seriously and see their doctor before their atherosclerosis leads
        to a heart attack.
