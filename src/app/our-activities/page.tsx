        The tide is turning but major challenges remain.

        The sum total of our awareness programme &#40;which we started with
        RM50,000&#41; has been increasing annually with the increase in
        activities. For year 2000 we spent RM300,000.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since 1993 approximately RM99,000 has been awarded in project grants and
        fellowships to further research in studies related to the heart, and
        since then, the Foundation has been allocating RM 10,000 annually to
        fund research.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Foundation awards <b>The Fellowship Research Grant</b> annually and
        our Technical Committee is responsible for evaluating all applications
        for research funds and fellowships.
        <br />
        <br />
        Education is the key to healthier lifestyles and prevention. The
        Foundation offers a comprehensive series of publications for the
        interest of the public. We also provide resources to students, teachers,
        employers and community groups and the media.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many of the Foundations ongoing programmes are well known in the
        community, such as, the <b>Heart Week</b> which is held 4-6 times each
        year and at different locations in the country. We bring fun along with
        a fitness message, and through health screening and forums, we create
        interest and awareness about risk factors related to cardiovascular
        diseases, healthy living and heart to the community at large.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Foundation also works towards creating interest in{' '}
        <b>Basic Life Support</b>. We work with health professionals and conduct
        demonstrations in the life - saving technique of CPR
        &#40;cardiopulmonary or heart lung resuscitation&#41; to develop
        interest in the community.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Health promotion programmes</b> in schools and workplaces, to
        encourage provision of healthy food choices and exercise in a healthy
        smoke-free environment.
